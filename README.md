## Next Steps

This application is a small jumping off point to a huge community for hikers. In the future I'd like to add features that allow hikers to look at other profiles and other hikers' accomplishments. Having a more interactive application is the goal, not only for users to interact with the application, but to connect with other people. The UI will most likely change in the future, too, as more locations are added along with index views of profiles, community review boards, areas to explore food, shopping, and other things people can do outside of hiking, and anything from user feedback. Logistical items I would like to add are light/dark mode, better background, and polished navigation bar.
