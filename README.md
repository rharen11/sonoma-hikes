# Welcome to Sonoma Hiking! :happy:

## This application allows the user to explore the beautiful Hood Mountain in Sonoma County, CA. With the many trails, outlooks, and wildlife the user is sure to find their way to a great experience with nature- all with the guidnace of this application!

- My motivation for this application is simple, I love to hike and want to help others come to love hiking as well!
- I build this application as a way for users to navigate throughout Hood Mountain based on users' criteria while also providing useful information used to prep for a hike.
- I learned how to build a smooth UI with the application, incorporating the MEN stack in a way that can be used fluidily by the user.
